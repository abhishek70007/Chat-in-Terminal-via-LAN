# Chat-in-Terminal-via-LAN
The Chat in Terminal via LAN project is a Java-based application that allows two computers connected via a LAN cable to communicate and chat with each other through the terminal. This project, developed during high school, provides a simple and non-GUI solution for real-time communication between two connected devices.
